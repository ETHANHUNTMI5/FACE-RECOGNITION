# FACE-RECOGNITION
- This project can identify faces from a video feed using Haarcascade Classifier

## FACE-DETECTION
- This uses a Haarcascade classifier object which is already trained and thus recognizes human faces.
- As the filter is already trained with a large number of faces it can easily recognize a new face which comes in front of it.
- A rectangular boundary is also drawn on the faces according to the co-ordinates given by the Classifier.
